1. Communications services : Core network

This suggests that the "Communication services" component is primarily responsible for the core networking functionalities of the National Information Network. The core network is the central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services to customers connected by the access network. It's the backbone that interconnects different parts of the network, ensuring data transmission between them.

The core network would handle the primary data routing and manage the main communication pathways. It would be responsible for ensuring efficient data transmission, handling network traffic, and maintaining connectivity across the entire network infrastructure.
